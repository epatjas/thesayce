Invest, change direction, or stop. My work is less about ideation and more about what comes after. Creating structure, momentum, and protection so promising ideas don't get crushed by timelines, politics, or premature ROI questions. I spend most of my time translating. Between strategy and execution. Leadership and teams. Ambition and reality. So progress actually happens.",
