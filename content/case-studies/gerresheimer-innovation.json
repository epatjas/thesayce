In a 150-year-old company operating in heavily regulated medical packaging, \"innovation\" meant incremental product improvements driven by customer requests—not systematic exploration of new opportunities. \n\nThe real constraints weren't technical. They were cultural and structural:\n\n* Every change requires compliance validation (FDA, EMA regulations)\n* Engineers optimized for risk avoidance, not experimentation\n* No budget or mandate for exploratory work\n* Innovation was everyone's side project and no one's priority\n",
