Lots of them. What it didn't have was a way of working that actually matched how decisions needed to happen. Teams were siloed across EMEA, product strategy was disconnected from execution, and \"continuous improvement\" was a department name, not a reality.\n\nThe real problem wasn't missing tools or frameworks. It was that nobody had designed how the organization should actually operate as a system.\n",
