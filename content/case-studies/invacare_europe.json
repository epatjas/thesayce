      "content": "Gerresheimer had no formal innovation function. In a 150-year-old company operating in heavily regulated medical packaging, \"innovation\" meant incremental product improvements driven by customer requests—not systematic exploration of new opportunities. \n\nThe real constraints weren't technical. They were cultural and structural:\n\n* Every change requires compliance validation (FDA, EMA regulations)\n* Engineers optimized for risk avoidance, not experimentation\n* No budget or mandate for exploratory work\n* Innovation was everyone's side project and no one's priority\n",

Meant I designed two programs that got killed in review because they didn't account for documentation requirements. Expensive lesson. Now I start every project with a coffee chat with the compliance team—not to ask permission, but to understand their constraints before I'm too invested in a specific approach.\n"
